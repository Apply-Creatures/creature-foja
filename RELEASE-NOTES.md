# Release Notes

A Forgejo release is published shortly after a Gitea release is published and they have [matching release numbers](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/CONTRIBUTING/RELEASE.md#release-numbering). Additional Forgejo releases may be published to address urgent security issues or bug fixes.

The Forgejo admin should carefully read the required manual actions before upgrading. A point release (e.g. v1.21.1-0 or v1.21.2-0) does not require manual actions but others might (e.g. v1.20, v1.21).

## 1.21.1-0

The [complete list of commits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commits/branch/v1.21/forgejo) included in the `Forgejo v1.21.1-0` release can be reviewed from the command line with:

```shell
$ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/
$ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges origin/v1.20/forgejo..origin/v1.21/forgejo
```

- **[Forgejo Semantic Version](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/user/semver/):**
  The semantic version was updated to `6.0.0+0-gitea-1.21.0` because it contains breaking changes.

- **Breaking:**
  Note that the modifications related to CSS, templates or assets (images, fonts, etc.) are not documented here.
  Although they can be extracted and modified, Forgejo does not provide any guarantee that such changes
  will be portable from one version to another (even a patch version). A [Q&A discussion is available](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues/84)
  to share tips and tricks. A new section was also added
  [to the developer documentation about interface customization](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/developer/customization/).
  - If you have custom asset files, e.g. custom themes, inside `custom/public/*` (css included), you need to transfer these files to `custom/public/assets/*` for them to be detected. Read more [in the documentation](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/developer/customization/) and the [Q&A discussion dedicated to interface customization](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues/84).
  - Git [branches are stored in the databases](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/6e19484f4d3bf372212f2da462110a1a8c10cbf2) to reduce the calls to a git process and improve performances. After upgrading, login as an admin, go to the `/admin` page and click run **Sync missed branches from git data to databases**. If this is not done there will be messages such as `LoadBranches: branch does not exist` in the logs.
  - [Some Forgejo CLI options have changed](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/d0dbe52e76f3038777c3b50066e3636105387ca3) and scripts may need to be updated. For instance `--verbose` is no longer a global option and is implemented on a per sub-command basis. Check `forgejo --help` or `forgejo docs` for more information.
  - [Remove "CHARSET" config option for MySQL and always use "utf8mb4"](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/ce46834b938eb687152a680669ada95a26304178). It has been a requirement for years and specifying anything else is likely to cause issues. Existing MySQL databases still using `utf8` can be converted using the CLI: `forgejo doctor convert`.
  - [Restrict certificate type for builtin SSH server](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/1172). This is a breaking change for setups where the builtin SSH server is being used and for some reason host certificates were being used for authentication.
  - [Set SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS_BACKUP to false by default](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/469d89b95a1ce18dd34808a95c7230375e828e24). There is no automatic cleanup of these backups and can end up using a significant amount of disk space over time.
  - [The minimum RSA keylength is now 3072 instead of 2048](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/c533991519816313dfaa0ddcec183756a97b9348).
  - Prior to this release, a token scoped to read or write permissions on issues was allowed to access both issues and pull requests, regardless of the restrictions imposed to the team in which they belong. In a team it is possible to grant finer grained permissions, for instance to allow a user to access issues but not pull requests. These restrictions are [now enforced](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/f4310d74ee65500ef02064256808530e09da76a0) and API calls that previously succeeded on `/api/v1/repos/{org}/{repo}/issues` or other endpoints common to both issues and pull requests could return 404. Granting the user the necessary permissions in the team in which they belong will allow them to use that endpoint again.
- **Forgejo Actions:**
  It is now enabled by default but should still be considered alpha stage and subject to unannounced breaking changes.
  - The API can now be used to manage secrets for [users](https://code.forgejo.org/api/swagger/#/user/updateUserSecret), [organizations](https://code.forgejo.org/api/swagger/#/organization/orgListActionsSecrets) and [repositories](https://code.forgejo.org/api/swagger/#/repository/updateRepoSecret).
  - [Registration tokens can register multiple runners](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/9b698362a333de2c388499f1a64d39545b0263bd) instead of a single one. Read more [about runner registration](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/admin/actions/#registration).
  - [Add](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/35a653d7edbe0d693649604b8309bfc578dd988b) support for [variables in addition to secrets](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/user/actions/#variables).
  - [Add](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/0d55f64e6cd3de2e1e5c0ee795605823efb14231) support for [recurring actions similar to cron jobs](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/user/actions/#onschedule).
  - [Add](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/19872063a3c14256a1d89b2a104d63e7538a3a28) the possibility to [disable workflows from the user interface](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/user/actions/#list-of-runners-and-their-tasks).
  - [Add](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/460a2b0edffe71d9e64633beaa1071fcf4a33369) automatic [cleanup of artificats](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/user/actions/#artifacts).
  - [Add](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/44781f9f5c4ede618660d8cfe42437f0e8dc22a0) automatic cancelation [of jobs when pushing new commits](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/user/actions/#auto-cancelation-of-workflows) to a PR.

```

This stable release contains a **security fix**.

* Recommended Action

  We **strongly recommend** that all Forgejo installations are [upgraded](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/admin/upgrade/) to the latest version as soon as possible.

* [Forgejo Semantic Version](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/semver/)

  The semantic version was updated to `5.0.8+0-gitea-1.20.6`

$ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.20.5-1..v1.20.6-0
```

This stable release contains a **security fix**, as explained in the [v1.20.6-0 companion blog post](https://forgejo.org/2023-11-release-v1-20-6-0/).

* Recommended Action

  We **strongly recommend** that all Forgejo installations are [upgraded](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/admin/upgrade/) to the latest version as soon as possible.

* [Forgejo Semantic Version](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/semver/)

  The semantic version was updated to `5.0.7+0-gitea-1.20.6`

* Breaking change

  Prior to this release, a token scoped to read or write permissions on issues was allowed to access both issues and pull requests, regardless of the restrictions imposed to the team in which they belong. In a team it is possible to grant finer grained permissions, for instance to allow a user to access issues but not pull requests. These restrictions are now enforced and API calls that previously succeeded on `/api/v1/repos/{org}/{repo}/issues` or other endpoints common to both issues and pull requests could return 404. Granting the user the necessary permissions in the team in which they belong will allow them to use that endpoint again.

* Security fix

  Additional API and web [endpoints now fail](https://forgejo.org/2023-11-release-v1-20-6-0/) when given manually crafted identifiers.

## 1.20.3-0

The [complete list of commits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commits/branch/v1.20/forgejo) included in the `Forgejo v1.20.3-0` release can be reviewed from the command line with:

```shell

This stable release includes bug fixes and a safeguard against a
regression that may lead to data loss. The `[storage*]` sections in the
`app.ini` file may cause the files for some subsystems - Attachments,
LFS, Avatars, Repository avatars, Repository archives, Packages - to
be merged together or misplaced.  The safeguard detects this situation
and Forgejo will not start to prevent data loss. If your instance is in
this situation, [follow the instructions in the companion blog post](https://forgejo.org/2023-08-release-v1-20-3-0/).

* Recommended Action

  We recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest version.

## 1.20.1-0

The [complete list of commits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commits/branch/v1.20/forgejo) included in the `Forgejo v1.20.1-0` release can be reviewed from the command line with:

```shell
$ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/
$ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges origin/v1.19/forgejo..origin/v1.20/forgejo
```

- **[Forgejo Semantic Version](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/semver/):**
  The semantic version was updated to `5.0.0+0-gitea-1.20.1` because it contains breaking changes.
- **Breaking:**
  - [Scoped access tokens](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/18de83b2a3fc120922096b7348d6375094ae1532) or (Personal Access Tokens), were refactored and although existing tokens are still valid, they may have a different scope than before. To ensure that no tokens have a larger scope than expected they must be removed and recreated.
  - If your `app.ini` has one of the the following `[indexer].ISSUE_INDEXER_QUEUE_TYPE`, `[indexer].ISSUE_INDEXER_QUEUE_BATCH_NUMBER`, `[indexer].`, `[indexer].ISSUE_INDEXER_QUEUE_DIR`, `[indexer].ISSUE_INDEXER_QUEUE_CONN_STR`, `[indexer].UPDATE_BUFFER_LEN`, `[mailer].SEND_BUFFER_LEN`, `[repository].PULL_REQUEST_QUEUE_LENGTH` or `[repository].MIRROR_QUEUE_LENGTH`, Forgejo will abort immediately. Unless you know exactly what you're doing, you must comment them out so the default values are used.
  - The `-p` option of `environment-to-ini` is [no longer supported](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/fa0b5b14c2faa6a5f76bb2e7bc9241a5e4354189)
  - The ".png" suffix for [user and organizations is now reserved](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/2b91841cd3e1213ff3e4ed4209d6a4be89c2fa79)
  - The section `[git.reflog]` is [now obsolete and its keys have been moved](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/2f149c5c9db97f20fbbc65e32d1f3133048b11a2) to the following replacements:
    * `[git.reflog].ENABLED` → `[git.config].core.logAllRefUpdates`
    * `[git.reflog].EXPIRATION` → `[git.config].gc.reflogExpire`
  - The [logger](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/4647660776436f0a83129b4ceb8426b1fb0599bb) used to display Forgejo's was refactored and has new settings, different from the previous one found at `log.<mode>.<logger>` in `app.ini`. Check the [documentation](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/admin/config-cheat-sheet/#log-log) and `app.example.ini` for more information. The SMTP logger was removed.
  - Forgejo will refuse to start if [the refactored path & config system](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/061b68e99) does not pass sanity checks (e.g. WORK_PATH must be absolute).
  - Manually set [WORK_PATH](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/admin/config-cheat-sheet/#overall-default) in `app.ini`.
    If the `app.ini` file is writable by the user under which the Forgejo server runs and `WORK_PATH` is not set,
    the server will add it. Otherwise it will log an error starting with `Unable to update WORK_PATH`.
    One of the consequences of not setting `WORK_PATH` in `app.ini` is that pushing to a repository via ssh is
    [likely to fail as explained in the corresponding bug report](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/1118).
    Read the technical details in the [commit that implements the WORK_PATH change](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/061b68e99).
  - The user profile can be customized with [a Markdown file](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/c090f87a8db5b51e0aa9c7278b38ddc862c048ac).
    The profile page of a user is rendered using the `README.md` file of the `.profile` repository, if it exists. It is a
    breaking change because **it will display the .profile/README.md of a pre-existing repository, private or not**.
  - The [API endpoint pagination](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/0a3c4d4a595cc7e12462dde393ed64186260f26b) for team members was fixed: it now starts at 1 instead of 0, just like all other paginated API endpoints.
  - The `SSH_KEYGEN_PATH` variable in `app.ini` now defaults to using the [Go SSH key parsing instead of the `ssh-keygen` binary](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/7a8a4f54321f208ebbb0f708a5f0e49c4cd4cc04). When `START_SSH_SERVER` is true, the decision to use the Go SSH key parsing or an external binary will now depend on the value of `SSH_KEYGEN_PATH` instead of always using the Go SSH key parsing.
  - The storage settings were [refactored](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/d6dd6d641b593c54fe1a1041c153111ce81dbc20). Read more about [storage settings](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/admin/storage/).
  - [The [repository.editor] PREVIEWABLE_FILE_MODES setting was removed](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/84daddc2fa74393cdc13371b0cc44f0444cfdae0). This setting served no practical purpose and was not working correctly. Instead a preview tab is always shown in the file editor when supported.
  - In addition to the already deprecated options inside [queue], many options have been dropped as well. Those are WRAP_IF_NECESSARY, MAX_ATTEMPTS, TIMEOUT, WORKERS, BLOCK_TIMEOUT, BOOST_TIMEOUT, BOOST_WORKERS. You can remove them from your app.ini now. Additionally, some default values have changed in this section.
  - The default CSS and templates included in Forgejo were heavily refactored and a large number of variables renamed. These changes are not documented and there is a very high chance that a tempate extracted and modified for a particular Forgejo instance will no longer work as it did. Browsing through the git history of the template in the sources is the best way to figure out how and why it was modified.
- **Moderation:**
  Blocking another user is desirable if they are acting maliciously or are spamming your repository. When you block a user, Forgejo does not explicitly notify them, but they may learn through an interaction with you that is blocked. [Read more about blocking users](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/blocking-user/).
- **Package:**
  New registries are available for [SWIFT](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/packages/swift), [debian](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/packages/debian), [RPM](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/packages/rpm), [alpine](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/packages/alpine), [Go](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/packages/go) and [CRAN](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/packages/cran).
- **Accessibility:**
  numerous improvements for [issue comments](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/6c354546547cd3a9595a7db119a6480d9cd506a7), [the menu on the navbar](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/a78e0b7dade16bc6509b943fe86e74962f1b95b6), [scoped labels](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/e8935606f5f1fff3c59222ebca6d4615ab06fb0b), [checkboxes and dropdowns](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/d4f35bd681af0632da988e15306f330e020422b2), [RTL rendering support to Markdown](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/32d9c47ec7706d8f06e09b42e09a28d7a0e3c526), [file (re-)views](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/e95b42e187cde9ac4bd541cd714bdb4f5c1fd8bc), [interactive tooltips](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/87f0f7e670c6c0e6aeab8c4458bfdb9d954eacec), [using a button element](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/81fe5d61851c0e586af7d32c29171ceff9a571bb), [repository list](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/e82f1b15c7120ad13fd3b67cf7e2c6cb9915c22d) and more.
- **Time:**
  The display and localization of time was improved for [tooltips](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/b7b58348317cbe0145dc453d45c886b8e2764b4c), [milestones](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/97176754beb4de23fa0f68df715c4737919c93b0), [due date and translations that contain dates](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/70bb4984cdad9a15d676708bd345b590aa42d72a), [commit graphs](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/5bc9f7fcf9aece92c3fa2a0ea56e5585261a7f28), [runners](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/62ca5825f73ad5a25ffeb6c3ef66f0eaf5d30cdf), [webhooks](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/dbb37367854d108ebfffcac27837c0afac199a8e), [tests](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/3d266dd0f3dbae7e417c0e790e266aebc0078814) and more. Previously each rendered timestamp would be static, now the real time since an event happend is show. If a comment was added 2 minutes before the page rendered it would show as "2 minutes ago" on the initial render and if another 8 minutes have passed, without a page refresh you'd see "10 minutes ago".
- **[Wiki](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/wiki/)**
  - Improve the [display of the table of content](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/1ab16e48cccc086e7f97fb3ae8a293fe47a3a452)
  - Fixed a bug [preventing team users who have wiki write permission from deleting a page](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/284b41f45244bbe46fc8feee15bbfdf66d150e79)
  - [Shows the External Link icon and URL in the header](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/d347208114966166ffa9655adc5b202676546c31) to indicate that the user will be sent to an external side to help prevent fishing

- **[Actions](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/actions/)**
  - The internal CI graduated from **experimental** to **[alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha)**. It now has with a [user](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/user/actions) documentation that includes examples and an extensive [administrator](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.20/admin/actions) guide to set it up.

* Bug fixes

  The most prominent ones are described here, others can be found in the list of commits included in the release as described above.

  * [Fix an edge case](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/27796464c) where a user changing their `username` in their profile page could fail
  * The secrets are only meaningful in the context of `Frogejo Actions`, do not display them if `Forgejo Actions` is disabled ([patch 1](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/5883db45c), [patch 2](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/5fdac0d46))
  * Actions can now be triggered on mirrored repositories ([patch 1](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/58bdcae61), [patch 2](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/8d4d6f9b2))
  * [Return `404` in the API if the requested webhooks were not found](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/16bcceeff) instead of `500`
  * Ensure topics deleted via the API are [also deleted in the repository](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/5dc29fdeb)
  * [Tentative fix](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/9bc4887cb) to suppress the JavaScript error **TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating '_i18n.textEdited')** on safari. It is unclear if that fix is effective because it could not be reproduced, please report if it still happens for you.
  * [Respect original content when creating secrets](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/f6919e3e5)
  * If a mirror failed and left the database in an inconsistent state, make it so the repository page [does not fail with an error `500`](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/f37fba567)
  * If a user that triggered `Actions` is deleted, [allow for the page listing the tasks it launched to show](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/f9bf040a5) instead of failing with an error `500`
  * [Allow the selection of milestones](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/55d062003) when acting on multiple issues in the issue list page
  * [Fix the API error message when trying to create a fork that already exists](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/4dccac3db)
  * [Don't display a `create page` button in a mirror wiki repository](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/7a74957c1). A mirrored repository will also mirror a wiki and changes will be overridden.
  * [Do not allow for a repository to enable actions if it is not enabled in the configuration](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/257287954)
  * Allow for closed PRs to be re-opened and [synchronize with the latest content of the head branch](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/306b7b5d1)
  * [Fix the `close` button of projects within an organization](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/306b7b5d1). It was a noop and now effectively closes the project

## 1.19.3-0

The [complete list of commits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commits/branch/v1.19/forgejo) included in the `Forgejo v1.19.3-0` release can be reviewed from the command line with:

```shell
$ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/
$ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.19.2-0..v1.19.3-0
```

This stable release contains security fixes.

* Recommended Action

  We recommend that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest version.

* [Forgejo Semantic Version](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/semver/)

  The semantic version was updated from `4.2.0+0-gitea-1.19.2` to `4.2.1+0-gitea-1.19.3` because of the rebuild with [Go version 1.20.4](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.20.4+label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* Security fixes

  * Forgejo was recompiled with Go version v1.20.4 published 2 May 2023. It fixes [three vulnerabilities](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.20.4+label%3ACherryPickApproved) ([CVE-2023-29400](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-29400), [CVE-2023-24540](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-24540), [CVE-2023-24539](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-24539)) related to the [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) package. The [Forgejo security team](https://forgejo.org/.well-known/security.txt) analyzed the security fixes it contains and concluded that Forgejo is not affected but recommended a rebuild as a precaution.

* Bug fixes

  The most prominent one is described here, others can be found in the list of commits included in the release as described above.

  * [Allow users that are not signed in to browse the tag list](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/e76b3f72b23bf778a562682d829744451b27d615). Requiring users to be signed in to view the tag list was a regression introduced in Forgejo v1.19.2-0.

## 1.19.2-0

The [complete list of commits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commits/branch/v1.19/forgejo) included in the `Forgejo v1.19.2-0` release can be reviewed from the command line with:

```shell
$ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/
$ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.19.1-0..v1.19.2-0
```

This stable release contains **important security fixes**.

* Recommended Action

  We **strongly recommend** that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.

* [Forgejo Semantic Version](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/semver/)

  The semantic version was updated from `4.1.0+0-gitea-1.19.1` to `4.2.0+0-gitea-1.19.2` because of the changes introduced in the internal CI.

* Security fixes

  * Token scopes were not enforced in some cases ([patch 1](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/7c3ac69c0) and [patch 2](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/10d3ed53f1cc6d383b52637bedd7bc3679476eb4)). The [scoped token](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/oauth2-provider/#scoped-tokens) were introduced in Forgejo v1.19 allow for the creation of application tokens that only have limited permissions, such as creating packages or accessing repositories. Prior to Forgejo v1.19 tokens could be used to perform any operation the user issuing the token could.
  * [Permissions to delete secrets was not enforced](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/68d80eb56). The experimental internal CI relies on secrets managed via the web interface, for instance to communicate credentials to a job. Secrets are only used in the context of the experimental internal CI.

* Bug fixes

  The most prominent ones are described here, others can be found in the list of commits included in the release as described above.

  * [Restore public access to some API endpoints](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/b00f7c3c545c6a00a747a5aea7596f45c50157ac). When [scoped token](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/oauth2-provider/#scoped-tokens) introduced in Forgejo v1.19, some API endpoints that were previously accessible anonymously became restricted: `/orgs`, `/orgs/{org}`, `/orgs/{org}/repos`, `/orgs/{org}/public_members`, `/orgs/{org}/public_members/{username}`, `/orgs/{org}/labels`.
  * [Fix 2-dot direct compare to use the right base commit](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/494e373292962de34b7ea7efd3f4a8d2f27daa26). For 2-dot direct compare, the base commit should be used in the title and templates, as is used elsewhere, not the common ancestor which is used for 3-dot compare.
  * [Make CORS work](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/2e6e5bc9c96ebb760f28c08423bb0c244ca7e01c). No [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) headers were set, even if CORS was enabled in the configuration.
  * [Fix issue attachment removal](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/d5f2c9d74d63443cc2abbcabc268cf1121f58e8b). When an attachment was removed from an issue or review comment, all of the image/attachment links were broken.
  * [Fix wiki write permissions for users who do not have repository write permissions](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/8c465206e2fea27076fdb986ea0478729653f0b5). When a team member had write access to the wiki but not to the code repository, some operations (deleting a page for instance) were denied.
  * [Respect the REGISTER_MANUAL_CONFIRM setting when registering via OAuth](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/116b6d5b27c40b248281f5fd543f7aa8df0d59d3). Contrary to the local registration, the OAuth registration flow activated a newly registered user regardless of the value of `REGISTER_MANUAL_CONFIRM`.
  * [Fix tags list for repos whose release setting is disabled](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/eeee32cdc3aab4d2086b24aae670a39501c9ea99). When releases was disabled the "tags" button led to a `Not Found` page, even when tags existed.

* Container image upgrades

  In the Forgejo container images the Git version was upgraded to [2.38.5](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.38.5.txt) as a precaution. The [Forgejo security team](https://forgejo.org/.well-known/security.txt) analyzed the security fixes it contains and concluded that Forgejo is not affected.

## 1.19.1-0

The [complete list of commits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commits/branch/v1.19/forgejo) included in the `Forgejo v1.19.1-0` release can be reviewed from the command line with:

```shell
$ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/
$ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.19.0-3..v1.19.1-0
```

This stable release includes bug fixes. Functional changes related to the experimental CI have also been backported.

* Recommended Action

  We recommend that all installations are upgraded to the latest version.

* [Forgejo Semantic Version](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/semver/)

  The semantic version was updated from `4.0.0+0-gitea-1.19.0` to `4.1.0+0-gitea-1.19.1` because of the changes introduced in the internal CI.

* Bug fixes

  The most prominent ones are described here, others can be found in the list of commits included in the release as described above.

  * [Fix RSS/ATOM/GPG/KEYS path for users (or orgs) with a dot in their name](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/085b56302cfd9a949319a3a1e32e008b4a0d0772). It is allowed for a user (or an organization) to have a dot in their name, for instance `user.name`. Because of a [bug in Chi](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/652) it was not possible to access `/user.name.png`, `/user.name.gpg`, etc. A workaround was implemented while a [proper fix is being discussed](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/pull/811).
  * [Creating a tag via the web interface no longer requires a title](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/1b8ecd179bdb58427b99c2c2eb9ad5a45abf7055).
  * [Use fully qualified URLs in Dockerfile](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/833a4b177596debc138e5723219fd063d067bd5b). The Dockerfile to create the Forgejo container image now uses the fully qualified image `docker.io/library/golang:1.20-alpine3.17` instead of `golang:1.20-alpine3.17`. This allows for building on platforms that don't have docker hub as the default container registry.
  * [Redis use Get/Set instead of Rename when Regenerate session id](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/3a7cb1a83b4ecd89421b5656b8caeb30c2b13c7c). The old sid and new sid may be in different redis cluster slot.
  * [Do not escape space between PyPI repository url and package name](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/cfde557e231417b7fb3cde3e9bab70d05b7d182f). It also adds a trailing slash to the PyPI repository URL in accordance to [Python PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/).
  * [Fix failure when using the API and an empty rule_name to protect a branch](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/abf0386e2ef6b56c048c04cd3d6913f453c87cb1). The `rule_name` parameter for the [/repos/{owner}/{repo}/branch_protections](https://code.forgejo.org/api/swagger#/repository/repoCreateBranchProtection) API now defaults to the branch name instead of being empty.
  * [Fix branch protection priority](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/580da8f35320dbd15b168bf8ccfaff6187ff87e0). Contrary to [the documentation](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/protection/#protected-branches) it was possible for a glob rule to take precedence over a non-glob rule.
  * [Fix deleting an issue when the git repo does not exist](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/1d8ae34e57e46b84a885b4f072d949344c5977c4). If a project had an issue tracker (such as the [Forgejo discussion](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues)) but [no git repository](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/), trying to delete an issue would fail.
  * [Fix accidental overwriting of LDAP team memberships](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/66aa85429684aca45753ac9578492ed3f7507ea3). If an LDAP user is a member of two groups, the LDAP group sync only matched the last group.

## 1.19.0-3

The [complete list of commits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commits/branch/v1.19/forgejo) included in the `Forgejo v1.19.0-3` release can be reviewed from the command line with:

```shell
$ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/
$ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges v1.19.0-2..v1.19.0-3
```

This stable release includes security updates and bug fixes.

* Recommended Action

  We recommend that all installations are upgraded to the latest version.

* Security

  The [Forgejo security team](https://forgejo.org/.well-known/security.txt) analyzed the vulnerabilities fixed in the latest [Go 1.20.3 packages](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20.minor) and [Alpine 3.17.3](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.17.3-released.html) and concluded that Forgejo is not affected.

  As a precaution the Forgejo v1.19.0-3 binaries were compiled with [Go 1.20.3 packages](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20.minor) as published on 4 April 2023 and the container images were built with [Alpine 3.17.3](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.17.3-released.html) as published on 29 March 2023.

* [Forgejo Semantic Version](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/semver/)

  The semantic version was updated from `3.0.0+0-gitea-1.19.0` to `4.0.0+0-gitea-1.19.0` because of the breaking changes described below.

* Breaking changes

  They should not have a significant impact because they are related to experimental features (federation and CI).

  * [Use User.ID instead of User.Name in ActivityPub API for Person IRI](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/2fcd57d5ae5b5926e5b0b87e46f78ad4ac83cbbd)

    The ActivityPub id is an HTTPS URI that should remain constant, even if
the user changes their name.

  * [Actions unit is repo.actions instead of actions.actions](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/9596bd3712caec440859fce93d05e19cf95e5330)

    All instances of `actions.actions` in the `DISABLED_REPO_UNITS` or `DEFAULT_REPO_UNITS` configuration variables must be replaced with `repo.actions`.

* Bug fixes

  They are for the most part about user interface and actions. The most prominent ones are:

  * [Do not filter repositories by default on the explore page](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/d15f20b2d2ce613cc8b36536995f29f81797c002). The behavior of the explore page is back to what it was in Forgejo v1.18. Changing it was confusing.
  * [Skip LFS when disabled in dump and doctor](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/b6a2323981a7a89205a382ddf0542e205e292d3d).
  * [Do not display own email on the profile](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/1fed0e1adc8dd2d27d2d7e34dda29c8e79e5e6e8).
  * [Make minio package support legacy MD5 checksum](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/b73d1ac1eb7d5c985749dc721bbea7ebd14f9c83).
  * [Do not triggers Webhooks and actions on closed PR](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/a04535e212b04c0f6643a4f36904a3d1bf30c63f).

## 1.19.0-2

The [complete list of commits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commits/branch/v1.19/forgejo) included in the `Forgejo v1.19.0-2` release can be reviewed from the command line with:

```shell
$ git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/
$ git -C forgejo log --oneline --no-merges origin/v1.18/forgejo..origin/v1.19/forgejo
```

* Breaking changes
  * [Scoped access tokens](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/de484e86bc)

    Forgejo access token, used with the [API](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/admin/api-usage/) can now have a "scope" that limits what it can access. Existing tokens stored in the database and created before Forgejo v1.19 had unlimited access. For backward compatibility, their access will remain the same and they will continue to work as before. However, **newly created token that do not specify a scope will now only have read-only access to public user profile and public repositories**.

    For instance, the `/users/{username}/tokens` API endpoint will require the `scopes: ['all', 'sudo']` parameter and the `forgejo admin user generate-access-token` will require the `--scopes all,sudo` argument obtain tokens with ulimited access as before for admin users.

    [Read more about the scoped tokens](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/oauth2-provider/#scoped-tokens).

  * [Disable all units except code and pulls on forks](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/2741546be)

    When forking a repository, the fork will now have issues, projects, releases, packages and wiki disabled. These can be enabled in the repository settings afterwards. To change back to the previous default behavior, configure `DEFAULT_FORK_REPO_UNITS` to be the same value as `DEFAULT_REPO_UNITS`.

  * [Filter repositories by default on the explore page](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/4d20a4a1b)

    The explore page now always filters out repositories that are considered not relevant because they are either forks or have no topic and not description and no icon. A link is shown to display all repositories, unfiltered.

    <img src="./releases/images/forgejo-v1.19-relevant.png" alt="Explore repositories" width="600" />

  * [Remove deprecated DSA host key from Docker Container](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/f17edfaf5a31ea3f4e9152424b75c2c4986acbe3)
    Since OpenSSH 7.0 and greater similarly disable the ssh-dss (DSA) public key algorithm, and recommend against its use. http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html

  * Additional restrictions on valid user names

    The algorithm for validating user names was modified and some users may have invalid names. The command `forgejo doctor --run check-user-names` will list all of them so they can be renamed.

    If a Forgejo instance has users or organizations named `forgejo-actions` and `gitea-actions`, they will also need to be renamed before the upgrade. They are now reserved names for the experimental internal CI/CD named `Actions`.

  * [Semantic version](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/semver)

    Since v1.18.5, in addition to the Forgejo release number, a [semantic version](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200) number (e.g. `v3.0.0`) can be obtained from the `number` key of a new `/api/forgejo/v1/version` endpoint.

    Now, it reflects the Gitea version that Forgejo depends on, is no longer prefixed with `v` (e.g. `3.0.0+0-gitea-1.19.0`), and can be obtained from the `version` key of the same endpoint.
* Features

  * [Documentation](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/)
    The first version of the [Forgejo documentation](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/) is available and covers the administration of Forgejo, from installation to troubleshooting.

    [Read more about semantic versions](https://forgejo.codeberg.page/docs/v1.19/user/semver)

  * [Webhook authorization header](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/b6e81357bd6fb80f8ba94c513f89a210beb05313)
    Forgejo webhooks can be configured to send an [authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) to the target.

    * [Cleanup rules](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/32db62515)
    * [Quota limits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/20674dd05)

  * [Option to prohibit fork if user reached maximum limit of repositories](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/7cc7db73b)
    It is possible for a user to create as many fork as they want, even when a quota on the number of repositories is imposed. The new `ALLOW_FORK_WITHOUT_MAXIMUM_LIMIT` setting can now be set to `false` so forks are prohibited if that means exceeding the quota.

    [Read more about repository configurations](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/admin/config-cheat-sheet/#repository-repository)

  * [Scoped labels](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/6221a6fd5)
    Labels that contain a forward slash (**/**) separator are displayed with a slightly different color before and after the separator, as a visual aid. The first part of the label defines its "scope".

  * [Support org/user level projects](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/6fe3c8b39)
    It is now possible to create projects (kanban boards) for an organization or a user, in the same way it was possible for an individual repository.

  * [Map OIDC groups to Orgs/Teams](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/e8186f1c0)
    When a user logs in Forgejo using an provider such as [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), they can now automatically be part of a Forgejo team, depending on the OIDC group they belong to. For instance:

    ```json
    {"Developer": {"MyForgejoOrganization": ["MyForgejoTeam1", "MyForgejoTeam2"]}}
    ```

    Means that the user who is in the OIDC group `Developer` will automatically be a member of the `MyForgejoTeam1` and `MyForgejoTeam2` teams in the `MyForgejoOrganization` organization.
    This mapping is set when adding a new `Authentication Source` in the `Site Administration` panel.

    A RSS feed is now available for releases at `/{owner}/{repo}/releases.rss` and tags at `/{owner}/{repo}/tags.rss`.

  * [Supports wildcard protected branch](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/2782c1439)

    Instead of selecting a branch to be protected, the name of the branch must be specified and can be a pattern such as `precious*`.

    [Read more about branch protection](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/protection/#protected-branches).

  * [Garbage collect LFS](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/651fe4bb7)

    The [git reflog](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog) are now active by default on all repositories and
    kept around for 90 days. It allows the Forgejo admin to recover the previous tip of a branch after an
    accidental force push.

  * [Actions](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/4011821c946e8db032be86266dd9364ccb204118): an experimental CI/CD

    It appears for the first time in this Forgejo release but is not yet fit for production. It is not fully implemented and may be insecure. However, as long as it is not enabled, it presents no risk to existing Forgejo instances.

    If a repository has a file such as `.forgejo/workflows/test.yml`, it will be interpreted, for instance to run tests and verify the code in the repository works as expected (Continuous Integration). It can also be used to create HTML pages for a website and publish them (Continous Deployment). The syntax is similar to GitHub Actions and the jobs can be controled from the Forgejo web interface.

    [Read more about Forgejo Actions](https://forgejo.codeberg.page/2023-02-27-forgejo-actions/)

    The `<video>` HTML tag can now be used in MarkDown, with the `src`, `autoplay`, and `controls` attributes.

  * [Copy citation file content in APA and BibTex format](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/9f8e77891)
    If a [BibTeX](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) file named `CITATION.bib` is at the root of the repository, it can be conveniently copied and converted in APA by following the `Cite this repository` link.

    <img src="./releases/images/forgejo-v1.19-citation-link.png" alt="Citation link" width="500" />

    It will open a dialog box with the available formats and a preview of the content.

    <img src="./releases/images/forgejo-v1.19-citation-dialog.png" alt="Citation dialog" width="500" />

    The CFF format is also supported when a `CITATION.cff` file used instead.

  * [Display asciicast](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/d9f748a70)

    Files with the `.cast` extension are displayed in the Forgejo web interface as [asciicast v2](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/doc/asciicast-v2.md) using [asciinema-player](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player).

  * [Attention blocks Note and Warning](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/cb8328853)

    For each quote block, the first `**Note**` or `**Warning**` gets an icon prepended to it and its text is colored accordingly.

    <img src="./releases/images/forgejo-v1.19-note-warning.png" alt="Attention block" width="400" />

  * [Support for commit cross references](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/d0d257b24)

    A commit hash can now be prefixed by the repository to be referenced from a comment in another repository: `owner/repo@commit`.

  * [Preview images for Issue cards in Project Board view](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/fb1a2a13f)

    If the card preview in the project is set to **Images and Text**, it displays images found in the corresponding issue. The most recent is displayed first, up to five images.

    [Read more about card preview images](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.19/user/project/#card-previews-images).

  * [Add "Copy" button to file view of raw text](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/e3a7f1579)

    If a raw text file is displayed, a copy button of the text is enabled.

    **Before**

  * [Setting to allow edits on PRs by maintainers](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/commit/49919c636)

    Add setting to allow edits by maintainers by default, to avoid having to often ask contributors to enable this.

* Container images upgraded to Alpine 3.17

  The Forgejo container images are now based on [Alpine 3.17](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.17.0-released.html) instead of Alpine 3.16. It includes an upgrade from git 2.36.5 to git 2.38.4 and from openssh 9.0p1 to openssh 9.1p1.

## 1.18.5-0

This stable release contains an **important security fix** for Forgejo to raise the protection against brute force attack on hashed passwords stored in the database to match industry standards, [as described in detail in a companion blog post](https://forgejo.org/2023-02-23-release-v1/).

### Recommended Action

We **strongly recommend** that all Forgejo installations are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.

If `PASSWORD_HASH_ALGO` is explicitly set in `app.ini`, comment it out so that the stronger algorithm is used instead.

All password hashes stored with another algorithm will be updated to the new algorithm on the next usage of this password (e.g. a user provides the password to the Forgejo server when they login). It does not require manual intervention.

### Forgejo

* SECURITY
  * Upgrade the default password hash algorithm to pbkdf2 with 320,000 iterations (https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/407)
* BUGFIXES
  * Return the Forgejo semantic version instead of "development" (https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/381)

### Gitea

* SECURITY
  * Provide the ability to set password hash algorithm parameters (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22942) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22943)
* BUGFIXES
  * Use `--message=%s` for git commit message (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23028) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23029)
  * Render access log template as text instead of HTML (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23013) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23025)
  * Fix the Manually Merged form (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23015) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23017)
  * Use beforeCommit instead of baseCommit (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22949) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22996)
  * Display attachments of review comment when comment content is blank (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23035) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23046)
  * Return empty url for submodule tree entries (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23043) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23048)
  * Notify on container image create (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22806) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22965)
  * Some refactor about code comments(https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/20821) (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/22707)

Note that there is no Forgejo v1.18.4-N because Gitea v1.18.4 was replaced by Gitea v1.18.5 a few days after its release because of a regression. Forgejo was not affected.

## 1.18.3-2

This stable release includes a security fix for `git` and bug fixes.

## 1.18.2-1

This stable release includes a security fix. It was possible to reveal a user's email address, which is problematic because users can choose to hide their email address from everyone. This was possible because the notification email for a repository transfer request to an organization included every user's email address in the owner team. This has been fixed by sending individual emails instead and the code was refactored to prevent it from happening again.

We **strongly recommend** that all installations are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.

### Gitea

* BUGFIXES

## 1.18.1-0

This is the first Forgejo stable point release.

### Forgejo

### Critical security update for Git

Git [recently announced](https://github.blog/2023-01-17-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-2/) new versions to address two CVEs ([CVE-2022-23521](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-23521), [CVE-2022-41903](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-41903)). On 17 January 2023, Git published the maintenance release v2.39.1, together with releases for older maintenance tracks v2.38.3, v2.37.5, v2.36.4, v2.35.6, v2.34.6, v2.33.6, v2.32.5, v2.31.6, and v2.30.7. All major GNU/Linux distributions also provide updated packages via their security update channels.

We **strongly recommend** that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.

* When using a Forgejo binary: upgrade the `git` package to a version greater or equal to v2.39.1, v2.38.3, v2.37.5, v2.36.4, v2.35.6, v2.34.6, v2.33.6, v2.32.5, v2.31.6, or v2.30.7
* When using a Forgejo container image: `docker pull codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo:1.18.1-0`

Read more in the [Forgejo blog](https://forgejo.org/2023-01-18-release-v1-18-1-0/).

#### Release process stability

The [release process](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/v1.18/forgejo-ci) based on [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) was entirely reworked to be more resilient to transient errors. A new release is first uploaded into the new [Forgejo experimental](https://codeberg.org/forgejo-experimental/) organization for testing purposes.

Automated end to end testing of releases was implemented with a full development cycle including the creation of a new repository and a run of CI. It relieves the user and developer from the burden of tedious manual testing.

#### Container environment variables

When running a container, all environment variables starting with `FORGEJO__` can be used instead of `GITEA__`. For backward compatibility with existing scripts, it is still possible to use `GITEA__` instead of `FORGEJO__`. For instance:

```
docker run --name forgejo -e FORGEJO__security__INSTALL_LOCK=true codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo:1.18.1-0
```

#### Forgejo hook types

A new `forgejo` hook type is available and behaves exactly the same as the existing `gitea` hook type. It will be used to implement additional features specific to Forgejo in a way that will be backward compatible with Gitea.

#### X-Forgejo headers

Wherever a `X-Gitea` header is received or sent, an identical `X-Forgejo` is added. For instance when a notification mail is sent, the `X-Forgejo-Reason` header is set to explain why. Or when a webhook is sent, the `X-Forgejo-Event` header is set with `push`, `tag`, etc. for Woodpecker CI to decide on an action.

#### Look and feel fixes

The Forgejo theme was [modified](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/v1.18/forgejo-branding) to take into account user feedback.

## 1.18.0-1

This is the first Forgejo release.

### Forgejo improvements

#### Woodpecker CI

A new [CI configuration](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/v1.18/forgejo-ci) based on [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) was created. It is used to:

* run tests on every Forgejo pull request ([compliance](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/tag/v1.18.0-1/.woodpecker/compliance.yml), [unit tests and integration tests](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/tag/v1.18.0-1/.woodpecker/testing-amd64.yml))
* publish the Forgejo v1.18.0-1 release, [as binary packages](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/releases/tag/v1.18.0-1) for amd64, arm64 and armv6 and [container images](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/-/packages/container/forgejo/1.18.0-1) for amd64 and arm64, root and rootless

#### Look and feel

The default themes were replaced by Forgejo themes and the landing page was [modified](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/v1.18/forgejo-branding) to display the Forgejo logo and names but the look and feel remains otherwise identical to Gitea.

<img src="./releases/images/forgejo-v1.18.0-rc1-2-landing.jpg" alt="Landing page" width="600" />

#### Privacy

Gitea instances fetch https://dl.gitea.io/gitea/version.json weekly by default, which raises privacy concerns. In Forgejo [this feature needs to be explicitly activated](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/v1.18/forgejo-privacy) at installation time or by modifying the configuration file. Forgejo also provides an alternative [RSS feed](https://forgejo.org/releases/) to be informed when a new release is published.
