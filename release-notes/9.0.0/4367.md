The caching of contributor stats was improved (the data used by `/<user>/<repo>/activity/recent-commits`) to use the configured cache TTL from the config (`[cache].ITEM_TTL`) instead of a hardcoded TTL of ten minutes. The computation of this operation is computationally heavy and makes a lot of requests to the database and Git on repositories with a lot of commits. It should be cached for longer than what was previously hardcoded, ten minutes.
