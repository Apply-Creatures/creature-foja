- when parsing [incoming emails](https://forgejo.org/docs/v8.0/user/incoming/), [remove tspecials from type/subtype](https://github.com/jhillyerd/enmime/pull/317). According to the RFC, content type and subtype cannot contain special characters and any such character will fail parsing. Removing the characters from the type/subtype can help successfully parsing the content type that contains some extra garbage.
