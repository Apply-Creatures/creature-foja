- Added Enter key handling to the new Markdown editor: Pressing Enter while in a list, quote or code block will copy the prefix to the new line - Ordered list index will be increased for the new line, and task list "checkbox" will be unchecked.
- Added indent/unindent function for a line or selection. Currently available as toolbar buttons ([#4263](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/4263)).
