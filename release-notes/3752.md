There are a couple of new configs to define the name of the instance. The more important is `APP_SLOGAN`. It permits to configure a slogan for the site and it is optional. The other is `APP_DISPLAY_NAME_FORMAT` and permits to customize the aspect of the full display name for the instance used in some parts of the UI as: (i) Title page, (ii) Homepage head title (ii) Open Graph site and title meta tags. Its default value is `APP_NAME: APP_SLOGAN`. The config `APP_DISPLAY_NAME_FORMAT` is used only if `APP_SLOGAN` is set otherwise the full display name shows only `APP_NAME` value.
