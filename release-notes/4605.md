feat: the default setting attachment.ALLOWED_TYPES was adjusted to allow .webp attachments in issues - a more efficient format for images like screenshots. All attachments are treated as normal files and are not re-encoded by Forgejo. If you have customized this setting, you may also want to add .webp to it for the benefit of your users, as well as to reduce server traffic and storage usage.
