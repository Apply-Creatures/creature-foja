      - Please speak English, as this is the language all maintainers can speak and write.
      - Be as clear and concise as possible. A very verbose report is harder to interpret in a concrete way.
      - Be civil, and follow the [Forgejo Code of Conduct](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/code-of-conduct).
      - Take a moment to [check that your issue hasn't been reported before](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues?q=&type=all&labels=78137).

      Please include information on whether you built Forgejo yourself, used one of our downloads, or are using some other package.
      Please also tell us how you are running Forgejo, e.g. if it is being run from a container, a command-line, systemd etc.

      It's really important to provide pertinent logs. You must give us `DEBUG` level logs.
      Please read https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/logging-documentation/.
      In addition, if your problem relates to git commands set `RUN_MODE=dev` at the top of `app.ini`.

      Please copy and paste your logs here, with any sensitive information (e.g. API keys) removed/hidden.
      You can wrap your logs in `<details>...</details>` tags so it doesn't take up too much space in the issue.
