      - Please make sure you are using the latest release of Forgejo and take a moment to [check that your issue hasn't been reported before](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues?q=&type=all&labels=78137).

      It's really important to provide pertinent logs. You must give us `DEBUG` level logs.
      Please read https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/logging-documentation/.
      In addition, if your problem relates to git commands set `RUN_MODE=dev` at the top of `app.ini`.

      Please copy and paste your logs here, with any sensitive information (e.g. API keys) removed/hidden.
      You can wrap your logs in `<details>...</details>` tags so it doesn't take up too much space in the issue.
