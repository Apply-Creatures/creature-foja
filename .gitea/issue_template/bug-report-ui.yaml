      - Please speak English, as this is the language all maintainers can speak and write.
      - Be as clear and concise as possible. A very verbose report is harder to interpret in a concrete way.
      - Be civil, and follow the [Forgejo Code of Conduct](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/code-of-conduct).
      - Take a moment to [check that your issue hasn't been reported before](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues?q=&type=all&labels=78137).
